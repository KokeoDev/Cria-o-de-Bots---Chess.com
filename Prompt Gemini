Use the first uploaded image as the facial reference for the man.



Use the other uploaded images strictly as art style reference.

Create a flat vector avatar illustration in the exact same style as the reference avatars:



– clean, modern flat design



– no outlines



– subtle gradients for depth



– simplified facial features



– soft, balanced color palette

Preserve facial likeness while adapting to a stylized illustrated look.



Solid background.
